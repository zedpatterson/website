Since freight is such an integral part of efficient supply chains, more realistic\ntransportation models can be of greater assistance. Transportation models in general have been moving\naway from the traditional four-step model into activity-based and supply chain-based models. Personal\ntransportation models take into consideration household demographics and why families travel.\nFreight research has yet to fully identify the relationships between truck movements and company\ncharacteristics, so most freight models use the methodology of personal transportation models, despite\nsituational differences. In an effort to classify freight companies into groupings with differentiated\ntravel movements, a survey of licensed motor carriers was designed and conducted in Oregon. The\nsurvey consisted of 33 questions. Respondents were asked about their vehicle fleets, locations served,\ntimes traveled, types of deliveries, and commodities. An analysis of the data revealed clusters of\ncompany types that can be distinguished by determining characteristics such as their role in a supply\nchain, facilities operated, commodity type, and vehicle types. An assessment of how the relationships\nfound can be integrated into state models is also presented.")]),e._v(" "),a("h4",{attrs:{id:"copyright-usage-permissions"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#copyright-usage-permissions"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Copyright & Usage Permissions")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("Public Domain")]),e._v(" "),a("h4",{attrs:{id:"publication-date"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#publication-date"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Publication Date")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("2013-March-")]),e._v(" "),a("hr")])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
