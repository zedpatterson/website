This is recognized in random utility choice models by including stochasticity in the development of the utility function of decision agents, representing the effects of unobserved (to the analyst) factors influencing the valuation of an alternative by an agent. This stochasticity translates utility valuations into the probabilities of choosing each alternative rather than predicting that an individual will choose a particular alternative with certainty.

This assumption is violated, for example, if a decision-maker assigns a higher utility to all transit modes (bus, train, etc.) because of the opportunity to socialize or if the decision maker assigns a lower utility to all the transit modes because of the lack of privacy. In such situations, the same underlying unobserved factor (opportunity to socialize or lack of privacy) impacts on the utilities of all transit modes. The presence of such common underlying factors across modal utilities has implications for competitive structure. The assumption of identically distributed (across alternatives) random utility terms implies that the extent of variation in unobserved factors affecting modal utility is the same across all modes. In general, there is no theoretical reason to believe that this will be the case. For example, if comfort is an unobserved variable the values of which vary considerably for the train mode (based on, say, the degree of crowding on different train routes) but little for the automobile mode, then the random components for the automobile and train modes will have different variances. Unequal error variances have significant implications for competitive structure.")]),e._v(" "),i("p",[e._v("The second assumption of the MNL model is that it maintains homogeneity in responsiveness to attributes of alternatives across individuals (i.e., an assumption of response homogeneity). More specifically, the MNL model does not allow sensitivity (or taste) variations to an attribute (e.g., travel cost or travel time in a mode choice model) due to unobserved individual characteristics. However, unobserved individual characteristics can and generally will affect responsiveness. For example, some individuals by their intrinsic nature may be extremely time-conscious while other individuals may be “laid back” and less time-conscious.

The assumption of identical variance across individuals can be violated if, for example, the transit system offers different levels of comfort (an unobserved variable) on different routes (i.e., some routes may be served by transit vehicles with more comfortable seating and temperature control than others). Then, the transit error variance across individuals along the two routes may differ. The assumption of identical error covariance of alternatives across individuals may not be appropriate if the extent of substitutability among alternatives differs across individuals. To summarize, error variance-covariance homogeneity implies the same competitive structure among alternatives for all individuals, an assumption which can be generally difficult to justify.")]),e._v(" "),i("p",[e._v("The three assumptions discussed above together lead to the simple and elegant closed-form mathematical structure of the MNL.
