Mode choice models are designed to be an integral link in the travel demand chain with feedback mechanisms to related model components potentially including: auto ownership, trip generation, trip distribution, and (modal) trip assignment.\nThe last set of mode choice models were developed for Austin in the early 1980â€™s. The City of Austin and the corresponding greater metropolitan area have undergone significant change in the last 20 years, including extensive growth and development. For these reasons, mode choice models were estimated entirely from local data gathered as part of the 1997 Home-Interview and Transit On-Board surveys.\nThe model structure used for the Austin mode choice models is a nested logit mode model, as opposed to a hierarchical or multinomial model.")]),e._v(" "),a("h4",{attrs:{id:"copyright-usage-permissions"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#copyright-usage-permissions"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Copyright & Usage Permissions")]),e._v(" "),a("h4",{attrs:{id:"publication-date"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#publication-date"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Publication Date")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("2000-July-1")]),e._v(" "),a("hr")])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=r.exports}}]);
